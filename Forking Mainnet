Alchemy access point to ETH mainnet.

Need a hardhat config like this for localhost:
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");

module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork: "hardhat",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
      forking: {
        url: "https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/LOjQWeWDMSJB1ROfLl0XR", ///here is important - alchemy gives access to ETH mainnet through API/project
        chainId: 31337,
      }
    },
    localhost: {
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:8545",
      chainId: 31337,
    }
  },
  solidity: "0.8.10",
};

####For contract deployment for Aave specifically, using pooladressprovider to deploy contract (see below). Not sure what this means for my project. (This was also embedded in smart contract)
- https://aave.com/docs/resources/addresses


###Go to Etherscan Io, tokens, top tokens, USDC, holders: (see list of commands for all of specific commands)
Take address of Token smart contract: 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48

Then take address of any holder:
SKY: PSM: 0x37305B1cD40574E4C5Ce33f8e8306Be057fD7341
